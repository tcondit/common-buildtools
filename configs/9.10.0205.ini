; This is a strange one.  There's no patch branch for this, because the whole
; job is to create a one-off Server installer for DFAS.  And since there's no
; branch, I'm using 9.10.0208.  We can't use 8's or 9's with branches because
; of octal digits in the code, so this is a good place to use it instead.  (Or
; is it?  I may be wrong about that.  We'll see.)
;
; Late note: No dice.  First compiler error is on AgentX.ocx.  I'm reverting
; back to using 9.10.0203.  Also, it's going to come from r10330 (the closest
; thing I've got to a 9.10 SP2 tag), instead of 9.10/maintenance/base.
